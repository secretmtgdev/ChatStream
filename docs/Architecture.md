# Chat System Architecture

## Overview
The goal is to develop a chat system similar to Messenger, WhatsApp, Hangouts, or Discord, with the integration of a dynamic chatbot using OpenAI's GPT.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: For building a responsive and dynamic user interface.

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express**: For handling server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Socket.io**: For real-time messaging between clients.
- **MongoDB**: To store user data, conversation history, and media (using GridFS).
- **JWT**: For user authentication in a stateless manner.

### Chatbot
- **OpenAI GPT API**: For generating dynamic chatbot responses.

### Deployment
- **Docker**: For containerization of the application and consistent environments across development, staging, and production.
- **PM2**: For process management in Node.js apps, ensuring the app stays alive and auto-restarts if needed.

## Features

### User Authentication
- **JWT** for stateless authentication of users.

### Real-time Messaging
- **Socket.io** for handling real-time communication between clients.

### Message Persistence
- **MongoDB** to store user messages, media, and conversation history.

### Media Sharing
- Storing files in MongoDB using **GridFS**.

### Rate Limiting & Throttling
- Implement rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse and ensure smooth operation.

### Chatbot Integration
- Use **OpenAI GPT API** for generating dynamic and context-aware responses in the chat.

## Future Considerations
- **Nginx**: For load balancing and reverse proxy once the app scales.
- **Redis**: For caching and managing in-memory data if needed in the future.

## Deployment Plan
1. **Local Development**: Start with Docker and PM2 for easy deployment and management.
2. **Cloud Migration**: Eventually migrate to AWS, using services like ECS or EKS, RDS for database management, and S3 for media storage.
